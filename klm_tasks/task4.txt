# task 4: calculating the result of (3^2 + 4^2) âˆ— 15.2 using only the keyboard
# as our calculator has no option for '^' we use '*' instead

2K  # '(' needs two key presses: Shift + 8
4K K 4K  # "3*3 + 4*4" ; "*" needs two key presses as well: "Shift" "+" -> therefore 3^2 needs 4 Keystrokes
2k  # for closing bracket
6K  # "* 15.2" (again 2 keypresses for '*')
2K  # clicking "Shift" and "="
